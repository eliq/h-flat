/** Possibly flush cached data
	 *
	 * BIG NOTE: This is not equivalent to fsync().  It's not a
	 * request to sync dirty data.
	 *
	 * Flush is called on each close() of a file descriptor.  So if a
	 * filesystem wants to return write errors in close() and the file
	 * has cached dirty data, this is a good place to write back data
	 * and return any errors.  Since many applications ignore close()
	 * errors this is not always useful.
	 *
	 * NOTE: The flush() method may be called more than once for each
	 * open().	This happens if more than one file descriptor refers
	 * to an opened file due to dup(), dup2() or fork() calls.	It is
	 * not possible to determine if a flush is final, so each flush
	 * should be treated equally.  Multiple write-flush sequences are
	 * relatively rare, so this shouldn't be a problem.
	 *
	 * Filesystems shouldn't assume that flush will always be called
	 * after some writes, or that if will be called at all.
	 *
	 * Changed in version 2.2
